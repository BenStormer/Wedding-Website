# Wedding-Website

Source code for the Aspen and Ben's Wedding Website

# Plan:

This section describes how the wedding website will look and function. It will be split into a mobile and desktop version.
Heavy inspiration (copying) from https://www.blakeandmolly2024.com/

The main pages for the website will be:

- [ ] Home
  - [x] Quick details
    - Image of us
    - Really like the "When", "Where", "Attire" cards on the reference website
  - [x] RSVP
    - Box that opens up with ability to enter name, email, and Yes/No
    - API call to backend to check that user is in RSVP list and set their status
       - [ ] Stretch goal: Confirm prompt for users that are updating a pre-existing RSVP
       - [ ] Stretch goal: Email and text users
  - [x] Link/Prompt users to other pages
    - Wedding Details
    - Visiting Nashville
    - Registry
    - FAQs
  - [ ] Our Story
    - [ ] Create image to be used
  - [x] Menu/Navigation to other pages
- [ ] Details
  - Timeline
  - About the venue
  - Parking, Attire, anything else that would concern attendees
  - Include FAQs here?
- [ ] Visiting Nashville
  - [ ] Recommended Hotels
    - Links to them and a blurb?
  - [ ] Things to Do
  - Events
  - Restaurants
  - Other sights to see
- [ ] Registry
- [ ] FAQs
  - Link to FAQs in details rather than have it's own page?

## Mobile Website:

The main focus should be on the scrolling experience. It is much better to scroll than try to click a bunch of buttons and tabs on a mobile phone, so the content should be planned around this.
